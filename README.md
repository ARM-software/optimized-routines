# üöÄ Arm Optimized Routines

![master branch](https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?event=push&branch=master)

**High-performance, architecture-aware implementations of common library
functions for Arm processors.**

This repository offers a collection of optimized implementations of various
library functions tailored for Arm processors. Whether you are developing for
embedded systems, mobile devices, or high-performance computing, these routines
are designed to maximize efficiency and performance on Arm platforms.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Here is a quick overview of the repository's layout:

- **`build/`**: Directory created by the build process.
- **`fp/`**: Floating-point basic arithmetic sources.
- **`math/`**: Elementary math subproject sources.
- **`networking/`**: Networking subproject sources.
- **`string/`**: String routines subproject sources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Testing

To build and test the routines in all sub-projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/optimized-routines.git
   cd optimized-routines
   ```

2. **Set up the build configuration**:

   ```bash
   cp config.mk.dist config.mk
   # Edit config.mk as needed
   ```

3. **Build and test**:

   ```bash
   make
   make check
   ```

**Building and Testing a single subproject**:

In order to build a single subproject `<sub>` use the following commands

```bash
make all-<sub>
make check-<sub>
```

Alternatively, the `config.mk` file can be updated to specify a list of
sub-projects.

**Cross-Building**:

For cross-building, set `CROSS_COMPILE` in `config.mk` and define `EMULATOR`
for cross-testing (e.g., using `qemu-user` or remote access to a target
machine). Refer to examples in `config.mk.dist`.
