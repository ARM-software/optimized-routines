# ðŸ§µ String

The string sub-project contains string routines (`memcpy`, `strcmp`, ...)
optimized specifically for Arm architecture.  These routines can be used as
replacement to string.h routines in the standard C library.

This document provides style requirements and contribution guidelines for
string routines.

## ðŸ“‚ Subdirectory Structure

Here is a quick overview of the **`string/`** subdirectory's layout:

- **`<arch>/`**: `<arch>`-specific string routines sources for `<arch>=aarch64`, and `arm`.
- **`aarch64/experimental/`**: Experimental string routines that fail to meet quality requirements listed below.
- **`include/`**: string library public headers.
- **`test/`**: string test and benchmark related sources.

## ðŸŽ¨ Style Requirements

1. **Upstream Compatibility**:
   Code should follow GNU Coding Standard and glibc specific conventions to
ease upstreaming.

2. **ABI and Symbols**:
   Code should be written so it is suitable for inclusion into a libc with
minimal changes, e.g.
   - Internal symbols should be hidden and in the implementation reserved
     namespace according to ISO C and POSIX rules.
   - If possible the built shared libraries and static library archives should
     be usable to override libc symbols at link time (or at runtime via
     LD_PRELOAD).
   - This requires the symbols to follow the glibc ABI (other than symbol
     versioning), this cannot be done reliably for static linking so this is a
     best effort requirement.

3. **API Headers**:
   Include headers should be suitable for benchmarking and testing code and
should not conflict with libc headers.

## âœ… Contribution Guidelines

- Clearly document assumptions in the code.
- Maintain consistent assembly style across different implementations.
- Benchmarking is needed on several microarchitectures.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will help maintain the quality and
consistency of the Arm Optimized Routines project. We appreciate your
contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
